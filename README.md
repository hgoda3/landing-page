## Content

**what you will find in the file**
1- I added the forth section and then worked on building the navigation bar.
2- I worked on the active status of the sections using *IntersectionObserver*.
3- I added a class in CSS called *active* to make the sections highlighted while scrooling and added the class to *Observer*.
4- And then i made the page scroll smothly using the *scrollIntoView* method.
5- And in the end i added a **Button** to scroll the page to the *TOP* and added its styling to the *Stylesheet*.
